## 197. Rising Temperature
Easy

SQL Schema
Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.
```
+---------+------------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | RecordDate(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
|       1 |       2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 |       2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 |       2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 |       2015-01-04 |               30 |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
```
For example, return the following Ids for the above Weather table:
```
+----+
| Id |
+----+
|  2 |
|  4 |
+----+
```

## SQL Solution
```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT weather.id AS 'Id'
FROM weather JOIN weather w ON
    DATEDIFF(weather.RecordDate, w.RecordDate) = 1
    AND weather.Temperature > w.Temperature
    
# Slower - 
# SELECT wt2.id AS 'Id'
# FROM Weather wt1, Weather wt2 
# WHERE wt1.RecordDate + INTERVAL 1 DAY = wt2.RecordDate 
# AND wt1.Temperature < wt2.Temperature;
```
