## 202. Happy Number
Easy

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.

**Example:**
```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

## Java Solution
```java
class Solution 
{
    public boolean isHappy(int n) 
    {
        HashSet <Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        int sum = 0;
        while(n != 1) 
        {
            //System.out.println(n);
            set.add(n);
            while(n != 0) 
            {
                sum +=  (n%10) * (n%10);
                n = n/10;
            }
            if(set.contains(sum))
                return false;
            n = sum;
            sum = 0;
        } 
        return true;
    }
}
```

**Complexity:**
* Time: O(???) 

A leetcode user tried for i = 0 to integer maximum value and time complexity is independent from given input.
For any positive integer, maximum iteration count is 16 before terminating the loop, and in every iteration, we calculate sum for maximum of 10 digits.
Thus time complexity is: O(16 * 10) = O(1)
Both floyd cycle detection or hashset solution works same and their space complexities are the same either, because O(16) = O(1).

* Space: O(???) - hashset
