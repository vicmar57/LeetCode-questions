# 9. Palindrome Number - Description

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

### Example 1:
```
Input: 121
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Java solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        //a negative cannot be a palindrome
        //a non-zero number ending with 0, cannot be a palindrome
        if(x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) 
        {
            return false;
        }
        
        int revHalfNum = 0;
        while(x > revHalfNum)
        {
            revHalfNum = revHalfNum * 10 + x%10;
            x = x/10;
        }
        
        //if the original number's length is odd, compare x and revHalfNum/10
        return x == revHalfNum || x == revHalfNum/10;
    }
}
```
