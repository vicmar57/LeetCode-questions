## 443. String Compression
Easy

Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.
The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.
Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.
After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

*Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?*
 
**Example 1:**
```
Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
``` 

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
["a"]

Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
``` 

**Example 3:**
```
Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
``` 

**Note:**
```
All characters have an ASCII value in [35, 126].
1 <= len(chars) <= 1000.
```

## Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        if(chars == null || chars.length == 0)
            return 0;
        
        int ind = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while(i < chars.length) 
        {
            int j = i;
            while(j < chars.length && chars[j] == chars[i])
            {
                j++;
            }
            chars[ind++] = chars[i];
            if(j-i > 1)
            {
                String count = j-i + "";
                for(char ch : count.toCharArray())
                    chars[ind++] = ch;
            }
            i=j;
        }
        return ind;
    }
}
```

**Complexity:**
* Time: O(n) - traversing the whole array
* Space: O(1)
