## [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

## Solution - use fast and slow pointers. if they meet - there is a cycle

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        if not head or not head.next: 
            return False
        slowRunner = head
        fastRunner = head.next
        
        while(slowRunner != fastRunner):
            if fastRunner == None or fastRunner.next == None: 
                return False
            slowRunner = slowRunner.next
            fastRunner = fastRunner.next.next
        return True
```

**Complexity:**
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(1) - only 2 pointers
