## 937. Reorder Data in Log Files

You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.
For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:

Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.
Return the final order of the logs.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
``` 

```
Constraints:

0 <= logs.length <= 100
3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.
```

## Java Solution
```Java
class Solution {
    public String[] reorderLogFiles(String[] logs) {
        if(logs == null || logs.length == 0)
            return logs;
        ArrayList <String> digLogs = new ArrayList <>();
        ArrayList <String> lettLogs = new ArrayList <>();

        for(int i=0; i < logs.length ; i++) {
            if(logs[i].split(" ")[1].charAt(0) < 'a') 
                digLogs.add(logs[i]);
            else 
                lettLogs.add(logs[i]);
        }
        
        Collections.sort(lettLogs, (l1, l2) -> {
            String [] s1 = l1.split(" ", 2);
            String [] s2 = l2.split(" ", 2);
            int cmp = s1[1].compareTo(s2[1]);
            if(cmp != 0)
                return cmp;
            return s1[0].compareTo(s2[0]);
        });
        
        lettLogs.addAll(digLogs);
                
        return lettLogs.toArray(new String [lettLogs.size()]);
    }
}
```

**Complexity analysis:**
* Time : O(nlog(n)) - where n is the total content of logs.
* Space : O(n).
