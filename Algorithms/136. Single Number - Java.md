## 136. Single Number - Description

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

## Java solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
	//xor-ing a number with itself returns 0
        int res = 0;
        for(int num : nums){
            res ^= num;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```


**Complexity:**
* Time: O(n)
* Space: 0(1)
