## [739. Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

## Solution
* - using stack. Thanks for CodeBix for the detailed explanation here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIal_OJx9FU !
When looking at temp[i], we don't care about the rest of the array, if temp[i] < temp[i+1], beacuse then we have an immediate answer ( ans[i] = i+1 - 1).

on the other hand, if temp[i] >= temp[i+1], we would like to know the temp values of the rest of the array until temp[j] - S.T temp[j] > temp[i],
and then again, ans[i] = j - i. 
If there isn't such a j, then ans[i] = 0.
A suitable data structure for keeping these ranges of elements is a stack.
At index i, while we haven't found a hotter temp, keep popping. if we found a hotter temp with ind j - ans[i] = j-i, else ans[i] = 0

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] T) {
        // input - [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
        //output - [ 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
        if( T == null || T.length == 0) 
            return new int [] {};
        Stack <Integer> inds = new Stack <>();
        int [] ans = new int [T.length];
        for(int i = T.length-1; i >= 0; i--)
        {
            while(!inds.isEmpty() && T[i] >= T[inds.peek()])
                inds.pop();
            ans[i] = inds.isEmpty() ? 0 : inds.peek() - i;
            inds.push(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
