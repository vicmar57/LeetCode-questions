## 451. Sort Characters By Frequency
Medium

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

## Java Solution
store character frequencies in hashmap, then put them all in maxHeap, and pull them out one by one, by the frequency.

```java
class Solution {
    public String frequencySort(String s) {
        HashMap <Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) +1);
        }
        
        //now we have all frequencies. build max heap from the hashmap
        
        PriorityQueue <Character> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b) -> map.get(b) - map.get(a));
        maxHeap.addAll(map.keySet());
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder ();
        while(!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            char c = maxHeap.remove();
            for(int i=0; i< map.get(c); i++) {
                sb.append(c);
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

**Complexity:**
* Time: O(nlog(n)) - traversing the string, constructing hashmap and heap
* Space: O(n) - for hashmap and maxHeap
