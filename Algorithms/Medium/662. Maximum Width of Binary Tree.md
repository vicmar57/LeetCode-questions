## 662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree
Medium

Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The binary tree has the same structure as a full binary tree, but some nodes are null.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 

           1
         /   \
        3     2
       / \     \  
      5   3     9 

Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4 (5,3,null,9).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 

          1
         /  
        3    
       / \       
      5   3     

Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 2 (5,3).
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2 
       /        
      5      

Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the second level with the length 2 (3,2).
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2
       /     \  
      5       9 
     /         \
    6           7
Output: 8
Explanation:The maximum width existing in the fourth level with the length 8 (6,null,null,null,null,null,null,7).
```

**Note: Answer will in the range of 32-bit signed integer.**

## Python Solution
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def widthOfBinaryTree(self, root):
        if not root: return 0
        q = [(root, 1)]
        ans = 1  # because cases like [1], [1,3] etc. has width 1
        
        while q:            
        # first element in q is leftmost element in that level and
        # last element is rightmost element
        # the difference in their position is the width of that level
            if len(q) >= 2:
                ans = max(q[-1][1] - q[0][1] + 1, ans)
            new_q = []          # this stores nodes for next level  
            while q:
                node, pos = q.pop(0) #pop leftmost element from queue (leftmost node in curr level)              
                if node.left: new_q.append((node.left, 2*pos))
                if node.right: new_q.append((node.right, 2*pos + 1))            
            q = new_q
        return ans

# another, cleaner solution  
#         width = 0
#         level = [(1, root)]
#         while level:
#             width = max(width, level[-1][0] - level[0][0] + 1)
#             # for _, node in level:
#             #     print(node.val , end = ', ')
#             # print()
# 
#             level = [kid
#                      for number, node in level
#                      for kid in enumerate((node.left, node.right), 2 * number)
#                      if kid[1]]
#         return width
```

**Complexity:**
* Time: O(n) - traversing the whole tree
* Space: O(n) - in worst case, we handle a complete tree and keep all the leaves in the queue.
