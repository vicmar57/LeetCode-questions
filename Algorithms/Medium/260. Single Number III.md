## 260. Single Number III
Medium

Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

**Example:**
```
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
```

**Note:**
```
The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?
```

## Python Solution

In the first" Single Number" problem, there was only one number that appears once, so the solution was to xor all number to get it. here we'll use a slightly different approach, because wer'e after two different numbers:
The two numbers must differ in at least one bit (or else they are the same),
so we'll find that bit, and divide all numbers to 2 groups - ones with that bit set to 1, and others with that bit set to 0.
Xor all numbers within each group to find each of the requested numbers

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        a, b = 0, 0
        xor = reduce(lambda x, y : x ^ y, nums)
        mask = 1
        while xor&mask == 0:
            mask = mask << 1
        for num in nums:
            if num&mask:
                a ^= num
            else:
                b ^= num
        return [a, b]
``` 

**Complexity:**
* Time: O(n) - traversing the whole array twice
* Space: O(1)
