## 287. Find the Duplicate Number
Medium

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

**Note:**
You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

## Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        if(nums == null || nums.length == 0)
            return -1;
        
        int min = 1; // minimal num possible
        int max = nums.length; //greatest num possible
        
        while(min< max) {
            int mid = min + (max-min)/2;
            int countSmallerThanMid = 0;
            for(int num : nums) {
                if(num <= mid)
                    countSmallerThanMid++;
            }
            
            if(countSmallerThanMid <= mid) //less numbers than we'd expect. increase the mid
                min = mid+1;
            else
                max = mid;  //more numbers than we'd expect. 
                            // the duplicate is smaller than the mid. search in that range.
        }
        return min;
    }
}
```

**The Idea**
The idea is to do a value-based binary search (as opposed to index-based), and to close in on the range where our number should be at.

**Complexity:**
* Time: O(n*log(n)) - for each binary search iteration, we do n operations in the for loop.
* Space: O(1)
