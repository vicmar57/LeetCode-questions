## 275. H-Index II
Medium

Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

**Example:**
```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
```

**Note:**
If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

**Follow up:**
This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

## Java Solution
```java
class Solution {    
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int h_ind = 0;
        int citLen = citations.length;
        int l = 0, mid, r = citLen - 1;
        while(l <= r) {
            mid = l + (r-l)/2;
            int cand = citLen - mid;
            if(cand <= citations[mid]) {
                h_ind = Math.max(h_ind, cand);
                r = mid-1;
            }
            else
                l = mid +1;
        }
        return h_ind;
    }
}
```

**Complexity:**
* Time: O(log(n)) - binary search
* Space: O(1)
