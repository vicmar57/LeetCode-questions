## 127. Word Ladder
Medium

Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.
Each transformed word must exist in the word list.

**Note:**
```
Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
```

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```

## Python Solution
```
We essentially build a graph from the word list, by making a dict with key as intermediate word, and value as list of word that map to this intermediate node.

For example, "dog"'s intermediate nodes are "*og", "d*g", and "do*"
than, after building this gragh (through the adjacency list represented as the dict), we run a bi-directional BFS for optimal performance
```

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution(object):
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.length = 0
        # Dictionary to hold combination of words that can be formed,
        # from any given word. By changing one letter at a time.
        self.all_combo_dict = defaultdict(list)

    def visitWordNode(self, queue, visited, others_visited):
        current_word, level = queue.popleft()
        for i in range(self.length):
            # Intermediate words for current word
            intermediate_word = current_word[:i] + "*" + current_word[i+1:]

            # Next states are all the words which share the same intermediate state.
            for word in self.all_combo_dict[intermediate_word]:
                # If the intermediate state/word has already been visited from the
                # other parallel traversal this means we have found the answer.
                if word in others_visited:
                    return level + others_visited[word]
                if word not in visited:
                    # Save the level as the value of the dictionary, to save number of hops.
                    visited[word] = level + 1
                    queue.append((word, level + 1))
        return None

        """
        :type beginWord: str
        :type endWord: str
        :type wordList: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """

        if endWord not in wordList or not endWord or not beginWord or not wordList:
            return 0

        # Since all words are of same length.
        self.length = len(beginWord)

        for word in wordList:
            for i in range(self.length):
                # Key is the generic word
                # Value is a list of words which have the same intermediate generic word.
                self.all_combo_dict[word[:i] + "*" + word[i+1:]].append(word)


        # Queues for birdirectional BFS
        queue_begin = collections.deque([(beginWord, 1)]) # BFS starting from beginWord
        queue_end = collections.deque([(endWord, 1)]) # BFS starting from endWord

        # Visited to make sure we don't repeat processing same word
        visited_begin = {beginWord: 1}
        visited_end = {endWord: 1}
        ans = None

        # We do a birdirectional search starting one pointer from begin
        # word and one pointer from end word. Hopping one by one.
        while queue_begin and queue_end:

            # One hop from begin word
            ans = self.visitWordNode(queue_begin, visited_begin, visited_end)
            if ans:
                return ans
            # One hop from end word
            ans = self.visitWordNode(queue_end, visited_end, visited_begin)
            if ans:
                return ans

        return 0
```

**Complexity:**
* Time: O(NeighborsForEachNode^(SourceToTargetDist/2) + NeighborsForEachNode^(SourceToTargetDist/2)) = 
* O(NeighborsForEachNode^(SourceToTargetDist/2)) - traversing the whole graph at worst case

* Space: O(len(wordList) * len(eachWordInList)) - for the dict/map that represents the graph, the visited sets, the queue, etc.
