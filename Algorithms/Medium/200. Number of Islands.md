## [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000

Output: 1
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
11000
11000
00100
00011

Output: 3
```

## Solution - "sink" the islands with DFS and count 1 for every island sunk

```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        if(grid == null || grid.length == 0) 
            return 0;
        int islandCnt = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<grid.length; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 0; j<grid[0].length; j++)
            {
                if(grid[i][j] == '1')
                    islandCnt += dfs(grid, i, j);
            }
        }
        return islandCnt;
    }
    
    public int dfs(char[][] grid, int row, int col)
    {
        if (row >= 0 && row < grid.length && col >= 0 && col < grid[0].length) //valid spot
        {
            if(grid[row][col] == '1')
            {
                grid[row][col] = '0';

                if(dfs(grid, row+1, col) == 1 &&
                   dfs(grid, row-1, col) == 1 && 
                   dfs(grid, row, col+1) == 1 &&
                   dfs(grid, row, col-1) == 1)
                    return 1;
                return 0;
            }
            return 1;
        }
        return 1;        
    }
}
```

**Complexity:**
* Time: O(n^2) - the worst case is where all the grid is a single island - we make a DFS that covers all n^2 cells,
* and we still traverse the rest of the grid after completing the DFS
* Space: O(1)
