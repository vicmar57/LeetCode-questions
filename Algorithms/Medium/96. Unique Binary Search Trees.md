## 96. Unique Binary Search Trees
Medium

Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n?

**Example:**
```
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
   ```

## Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int numTrees(int n) {
        int [] numBSTs =  new int [n+1];
        numBSTs[0] = numBSTs[1] = 1;
        
        for(int nodesNum =2; nodesNum <= n; nodesNum++) {
            //consider each number as the root. say we have 1,2,3,4,5 and 
            // 2 is the root.
            //1 would have to be on the left, and 3,4,5 on the right. 
            // So the number of combinations with 2 as the root is the 
            // number of combinatios for the left subtree, 
            // times the # of combinations for right subtree.
            for(int root = 1; root <= nodesNum; root++) { //pick the root
                numBSTs[nodesNum] += numBSTs[root-1] * numBSTs[nodesNum-root]; 
                // root-1 nodes would be on the left subtree, 
                // and n-root nodes would be on the right subtree
            }
        }
        return numBSTs[n];
    }
}
```

**Complexity:**
* Time: O(n^2) - 2 for loops
* Space: O(n) - dp array
