## 994. Rotting Oranges
Medium

In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:

the value 0 representing an empty cell;
the value 1 representing a fresh orange;
the value 2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return -1 instead.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation:  The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation:  Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
``` 

```
Note:
1 <= grid.length <= 10
1 <= grid[0].length <= 10
grid[i][j] is only 0, 1, or 2.
```

## Python Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def orangesRotting(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        freshOranges = set()
        rottenOranges = set()
        
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    freshOranges.add(str(i) + str(j))
                elif grid[i][j] == 2:
                    rottenOranges.add(str(i) + str(j))
        
        minutes = 0
        directions = [[0,1], [1,0], [0,-1], [-1,0]]
        
        while(len(freshOranges) > 0):
            infectedOranges = set()
            for rotten in rottenOranges:
                i = int(rotten[0])
                j = int(rotten[1])
                for direc in directions:
                    nextI = i + direc[0]
                    nextJ = j + direc[1]
                    if ("" + str(nextI) + str(nextJ)) in freshOranges:
                        infectedOranges.add(str(nextI) + str(nextJ))
                        freshOranges.remove(str(nextI) + str(nextJ))
                
            if len(infectedOranges) == 0:
                return -1
            else:
                rottenOranges = infectedOranges
                minutes += 1
                
                                     
        return minutes
```

**Complexity:**
* Time: O(m*n) - traversing the whole grid
* Space: O(m*n) - at worst case, all oranges but one are fresh at the begining
